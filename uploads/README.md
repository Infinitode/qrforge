An open-source Python library for code encryption, decryption, and safe evaluation using Python's built-in AST module, complete with allowed functions, variables, built-in imports, timeouts, and blocked access to attributes.

*CodeSafe is an experimental library, and we're still running some tests on it. If you encounter any issues, or have an edge use case, please let us know.*

> [!NOTE]
> **CodeSafe** is intended to quickly encrypt/decrypt code files, and run them (only for Python script files) while in their encrypted form, but not as a means for powerful encryption, just code obfuscation. We have also included a `safe_eval` function, that can safely evaluate expressions within a safe environment.

## Security Advisory

### Critical Vulnerability Fixed in v0.0.5

**Versions 0.0.1 through 0.0.4 contain a known sandbox escape vulnerability in `safe_eval()` that allows arbitrary code execution.**

- **Vulnerability**: The `safe_eval()` function in versions 0.0.1-0.0.4 is vulnerable to a sandbox escape via indirect subscript lookup (e.g., `__builtins__['exec'](...)`). This bypasses the AST validation and allows execution of arbitrary Python code.
- **Impact**: An attacker controlling an expression passed to `safe_eval()` can execute arbitrary Python code with the application's permissions.
- **Affected Versions**: 0.0.1, 0.0.2, 0.0.3, 0.0.4
- **Fixed In**: Version 0.0.5 and later

**If you are using any version from 0.0.1 to 0.0.4, you should upgrade to version 0.0.5 or later immediately.** These earlier versions should **not** be used in untrusted expression evaluation environments.

The fix includes:
1. Rejecting all `ast.Call` nodes unless the exact target is explicitly whitelisted (including calls via subscript, attribute, and other indirect targets)
2. Using a minimal built-ins allowlist that excludes dangerous functions like `exec`, `eval`, `compile`, and `__import__`
3. Added comprehensive regression tests for indirect call targets

## Vulnerability & Security Testing (`test_poc.py`)

CodeSafe v0.0.5+ includes a rigorous test suite (`TestVulnerabilityFixes` and `TestEdgeCases` in `test_poc.py`) to systematically verify that `safe_eval` blocks sandbox escapes while preserving standard evaluation features.

### Test Results Summary

**49/49 Security & Edge Case Tests Passing** (`100% Pass Rate` across all vector categories)

| Attack Vector / Category | Specific Vectors Tested | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AST Subscript & Indirect Calls** | `__builtins__['exec']()`, `__builtins__['eval']()`, `__builtins__['__import__']()`, `getattr(__builtins__, 'exec')`, nested subscript access | **[PASS] Blocked** |
| **Dunder Attribute Escapes** | `__class__`, `__bases__`, `__mro__`, `__subclasses__`, `__globals__`, `__closure__`, `__code__` | **[PASS] Blocked** |
| **Class Hierarchy Traversal** | `object.__subclasses__()`, `type().subclasses()` | **[PASS] Blocked** |
| **Expression Bypasses** | Comprehensions (list, dict, set), generator expressions, short-circuit logic (`and`/`or`), ternary operators, tuple unpacking, walrus operator (`:=`), lambda calls | **[PASS] Blocked** |
| **Module & I/O Execution** | Direct/from `import`, `os.system`, `subprocess`, `io.open`, `socket`, `requests`, `urllib`, `pathlib` write operations | **[PASS] Blocked** |
| **Dangerous Built-ins** | `exec()`, `eval()`, `compile()`, `input()`, `open()` (default settings), modifying `__builtins__` | **[PASS] Blocked** |
| **Functional Baseline** | Safe arithmetic, string/list/dict operations, standard safe builtins (`len`, `max`, `abs`), explicitly allowed functions | **[PASS] Working** |

### Running the Proof of Concept Tests

To run the security PoC suite locally:

```bash
python -m unittest test_poc.py -v

### Changelog v0.0.5:

* **Security Fix**: Patched critical sandbox escape vulnerability in `safe_eval()` (CVE pending), thanks to [@hkmj19](https://github.com/hkmj19)/[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemanth-kumar-mj-24b50a256/) for reporting.
* Blocked indirect function calls via `ast.Subscript`, `ast.Attribute`, and other non-`ast.Name` targets
* Implemented minimal safe builtins whitelist excluding `exec`, `eval`, `compile`, `__import__`, and similar dangerous functions
* Added regression tests for indirect call bypass attempts

### Changelog v0.0.4:

* Major performance optimizations for encryption and decryption (~10x speedup).
* Optimized `safe_eval` by pre-filtering builtins and reducing internal overhead.
* Added support for `bytes` input in `encrypt`.
* Added support for file-like stream objects in `run` and `decrypt_to_file`.
* Standardized error handling (replaced `print` with exceptions).

### Changelog v0.0.3:

* Added an `allow_attributes` parameter to `safe_eval` and set `immediate_termination` to be `True` by default for safer function calling.

### Changelog v0.0.2:

* Fixed function returns.
* Added error handling to `CodeSafe`, removed some print statements with edits from `@0XC7R`.

### Changelog v0.0.1:

* Initial release

## Installation

You can install CodeSafe using pip:

```bash
pip install codesafe

```

## Supported Python Versions

CodeSafe supports the following Python versions:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8
* Python 3.9
* Python 3.10
* Python 3.11/Later (Preferred)

Please ensure that you have one of these Python versions installed before using CodeSafe. CodeSafe may not work as expected on lower versions of Python than the supported.

## Features

* **Safe Eval**: Safely allow `eval()` expressions to run, while maintaining complete control over the entire evaluation process.
* **Code Encryption/Decryption**: Quickly encrypt your code. This is meant for code obfuscation, and not high-level encryption.
* **Run encrypted code at runtime**: Run your encrypted code files, without needing to expose your code to end-users.

> [!NOTE]
> Running encrypted files at runtime using `run()` are only available in formats that can be understood by Python.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running `safe_eval`, make sure to wait for the Python file to finish its bootstrapping phase. This can be done by simply waiting for:
> ```python
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>    # Run eval, etc.
> 
> ```
> 
> 
> If you're planning on including `safe_eval` in executables:
> ```python
> import multiprocessing
> if __name__ == '__main__':
>       multiprocessing.freeze_support()
>       # Call safe_eval afterwards
> 
> ```
> 
> 
> You can read more about why this needs to be done here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/windows.html#multiprocessing-error-without-if-clause-protection

## Usage

### Safe Eval

```python
from codesafe import safe_eval

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run a normal, safe expression
    expression = "1 + 1"
    disallowed_expression = "os.getcwd()"

    result1 = safe_eval(expression, timeout=10, immediate_termination=True)
    result2 = safe_eval(disallowed_expression, timeout=10, immediate_termination=True)

```

> [!NOTE]
> Attribute inspection is disabled when using `safe_eval`. You can read more about how to use `safe_eval` from [here](https://infinitode-docs.gitbook.io/documentation/package-documentation/codesafe-package-documentation?utm_source=gemini).

### Encrypt & Run Code

```python
from codesafe import encrypt_to_file, decrypt_to_file, run

code = """
greetJohnny = "Hello Johnny!"

def greet_someone(greeting):
    print(greeting)

greet_someone(greetJohnny)
"""

# Encrypt the code
encrypted_file_path = "encrypted_code.encrypt"
encrypt_to_file(code, encrypted_file_path)

# Run the encrypted code
run(encrypted_file_path) # Hello Johnny!

# Decrypt code to another file
output_file = "decrypted_code.py"
decrypt_to_file(encrypted_file_path, output_file)

```
